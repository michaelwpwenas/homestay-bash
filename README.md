# YU|PO - Homestay (Database Bash)
Bash scripts to manage the visitors in YU|PO - Homestay. `initialize_db.sh` script is to initialize the database, and the CRUD function is available in the `manage_db.sh`. When initialized, it will generate a .db file running on SQLite3.
# How-to-run
1. Navigate to the directory, then run `bash initialize_db.sh` in the terminal (one-time). 
2. For further CRUD use, run `bash manage_db.sh` in the terminal.

This is just a fun side-project I made while I'm having my mid-term tests.
